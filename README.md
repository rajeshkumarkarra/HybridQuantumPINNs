# What is Hybrid Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (HQPINNs)?
![PINNs_plannet](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e557ed1-cd77-4432-85c7-f5ea14cbb122)

Hybrid Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Networks (HQPINNs) are a novel fusion of **quantum computing**, **deep learning**, and **physics-based modeling** that aim to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) by leveraging both classical neural networks and quantum circuits. These models are particularly useful for problems governed by known physical laws, where data may be scarce but the governing equations are well understood.

## üìò Why HQPINNs?

Traditional PINNs embed physical laws (like Navier-Stokes or Schr√∂dinger equations) into the loss function of a neural network. However, as physical systems grow in complexity or enter the quantum domain, classical computation becomes a bottleneck due to issues like the **curse of dimensionality** and **non-convex optimization**.

Quantum computing offers new opportunities:
- **Superposition and entanglement** allow for representation of high-dimensional solutions.
- **Quantum circuits** can potentially speed up function approximation and optimization.

Thus, HQPINNs combine:
- Classical PINNs to capture boundary conditions and data-driven constraints.
- Quantum sub-networks (variational quantum circuits) for function representation or PDE component solutions.
- Hybrid training using classical-quantum optimizers (e.g., ADAM + SPSA or COBYLA).

- Predict pollutant spread and groundwater recharge under different climate scenarios.

### 4. **Inverse Problems in Physics**
- Infer unknown coefficients in PDEs (e.g., reaction rates, diffusivities, potentials).
- Useful for discovering unknown physics from limited experimental data.

### 5. **Seismic Imaging and Geophysical Exploration**
- Model elastic wave propagation to locate oil, gas, or geothermal reservoirs.
- Train HQPINNs with sparse seismic data and embed wave equations into the network.
